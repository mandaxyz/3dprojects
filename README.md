# Repository Name: 3dprojects

I named this repository 3dprojects to:

- Increase its visibility in search results (e.g., Google).

- Keep it simple enough to remember long-term.

A too-generic name would make it hard to find, while an overly complex one would be difficult to recall. This balances both needs.
